When designing this project I had in mind a very simple looking site. For the actual WireFrame / mockup I used <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq Wireframes.</a><br>

# Features.
## index.html header - This is the main header text "How well do you know crypto?" 
* This header text's aim is to ask the user a question that they answer in there head. It sets a challenge for the user and makes the site more personal.

## Background Color/Image.
* The body background is a black to gray gradient image I took from Google, This gives the site a serious feeling as well as a cool color scheme.

## Six Questions.
* The six questions I used are some of the basic things a beginner should know, These questions are made to seem easy for the user but puts them to the test when they have to answer them.

## Question Answers.
* The question answers are a simple multiple choice A,B or C buttons. The aim was to make these answers change color and alert the user of if they were correct or not, With  red or green color displaying over the answer they picked.

## Submit button
* This button is placed at the bottom of the screen, Once the user has completed the questions they can get there score via an alert once clicking the submit button.

# Features left to implement.
* Unfortunately due to personal time issues, I didn't have enough time to add any interactive features. I Hope I get the opportunity to redo this project to the standard I wanted.

* I would also like to implement a mini snakes and ladders game on a second page but replace the snakes and ladders with crypto coins.

# Lighthouse Report
* On the index.html page I clicked inspect element then pressed lighthouse in the top right corner. This generates a report. Here that is...

# Deployment
* Before the website was deployed,
I had to use a temporary site ( Http.server ) to see the live changes while coding, To do this I used the ( Python3 -m http.server ) command in GitPod and that allowed me to see a live preview of my site while coding.

* The project was deployed on GitHub Pages.
I used Gitpod as a development environment where I then committed all changes to github, I used (Git commit -m "" ) then (Git push) command in Gitpod to save changes to GitHub.

* Once my site was ready to deploy online, I had to:
Log in to GitHub and click on repository to deploy (How-Well-Do-You-Know-Crypto) select Settings and find GitHub Pages section at the very bottom of the page from source select none and then change the branch from "none" to "main" then once that was done, I clicked save and the site was deployed after a refresh of the page.
